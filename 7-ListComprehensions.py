'''
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. Write one line of Python that
takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements
of this list in it.

The idea of a list comprehension is to make code more compact to
accomplish tasks involving lists.
